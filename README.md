# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

We will visually show the differences in between magnitudes of earthquakes all around the world for the past seven days; with the use of use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
Furthermore, with the use of JavaScript and the D3.js library we will retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
Next, with Leaflet library the data analytics team will plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
